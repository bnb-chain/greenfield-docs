|         Universal endpoint         | Users can access files stored on Greenfield through any SP in the SP network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Testnet |
|               Folder               | Greenfield supports prefix queries and delimiter queries for files within buckets, allowing dApps to organize folders on top of Greenfield                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Testnet |
|          Batch operations          | Currently, Greenfield does not support batch file creation/deletion operations. However, users can assign the corresponding permissions to third-party users, allowing third-party users to perform batch processing through a backend program to avoid frequent wallet signature prompts on the frontend. Greenfield will provide native support for batch processing in the future                                                       |  Plan   |
|           Data challenge           | Greenfield uses the data challenge scheme as a guarantee of data existence. Greenfield will randomly challenge the data segments stored on SPs. Users can also challenge any data segments stored on SPs to ensure that SPs correctly store their data                                                                                                                                                                                     | Testnet |
|           Data recovery            | Data recovery is used to ensure that the original data can be recovered when certain data is lost on SPs, ensuring the reliability of user data on Greenfield. Greenfield supports various forms of data recovery: 1. Data will be automatically recovered after data challenge succeeds. 2. Data will be automatically recovered when users find that the data is unreadable. 3. SPs can selectively recover some lost data through tools | Testnet |
| Large object and breakpoint resume | Greenfield supports breakpoint resume, which improves the efficiency and user experience of object transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Testnet |
|          SP graceful exit          | When SPs want to exit voluntarily for some reason, Greenfield can support SPs to migrate the previously stored data to other SPs and then exit, so that the freedom of SPs is ensured without affecting the availability of data on Greenfield                                                                                                                                                                                             |   Dev   |
|           Migrate bucket           | Greenfield supports users to migrate their bucket from one SP to another                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   Dev   |
|  Expiration time for group member  | Greenfield supports setting expired time for group members                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |   Dev   |

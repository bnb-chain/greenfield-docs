# Roadmap

## Upcoming

### August 31st, Upgrade Mekong Testnet

This version will implement a hard fork for Greenfield MeKong Testnet, which can be upgraded with zero downtime. At the
same time, this version will introduce some advanced features:

- Support SP graceful exit: It enables SP to join the network freely and exit the network without affecting the user storage experience
- Support migrating bucket: Users can migrate their bucket from one SP to another on their own needs
- Support expired group member: Group members can be given an expiration time, after which they will no longer have
  access to the group even though their account remains part of the group

### September 7th, Mekong Testnet Nagqu Hardfork
Nagqu hardfork is an experimental upgrade on the Greenfield Testnet. By introducing a break change and upgrading through
hardfork, Greenfield can smoothly transition, which means we can upgrade Greenfield through hardfork in the future without
any downtime. This version will introduce one key feature:

- Support deposit payment account bank module funds into payment module.

### October, Launch Mainnet Lena

This version will be our first version for Greenfield Mainnet, including all key features introduced on the Testnet.

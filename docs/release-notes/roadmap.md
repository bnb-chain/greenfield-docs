# Roadmap

## Upcoming

### June 25th, Reset Mekong Testnet

This version will mainly focus on refining the SP standard framework. Community developers can then implement their own
SP services according to the framework. It will include the following features:

- Refine a standard framework about SP's protocol, API, performance, and security requirements
- Support universal endpoint for private objects: You can index a private object with the Greenfield URL in the browser
  once you have permission
- Support multi-message transactions: Wrap several messages into a transaction, which means we can sign once for multiple
  messages, this will tremendously improve the user experience

### July 20th, Reset Mekong Testnet

This version will focus on improving the performance and stability of the SP. At the same time, this version will introduce
some advanced features:

- Support data recovery: Recover the data stored on SPs automatically to ensure the data availability on Greenfield
- Support large object and breakpoint resume transfer: Resume data transfer will tremendously improve the transfer
  efficiency and user experience when uploading or downloading a large object from Greenfield
- Support SP graceful exit: It enables SP to join the network freely and exit the network without affecting the user storage experience

### August, Launch Mainnet Lena

This version will be a maintenance version for bugfix and enhancement focusing on reducing the cost of operating an SP
and adapting the economy to make SP profitable:

- Support rich underlying storage platforms, such as GCP, B2, and Ali-Cloud OSS
- Adapt the storage economy to make SP profitable

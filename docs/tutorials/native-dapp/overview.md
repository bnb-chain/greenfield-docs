# Overview
Native apps are applications developed only using the Greenfield SDK, without involving the development of smart contracts.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each native application, providing step-by-step guides, code snippets, and best practices to empower you to create powerful and innovative dApps without the need for smart contract development.

## CLI

BNB Greenfield provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) that is reminiscent of well-known cloud storage providers. This CLI facilitates interaction with decentralized storage via command-line operations, allowing you to create operating system scripts such as bash scripts.

Here are tutorials using the CLI:
* [Basic File Management](/docs/tutorials/native-dapp/cli/file-management/overview)
* [Hosting a Website](/docs/tutorials/native-dapp/cli/hosting-websites/overview)

## SDK

BNB Greenfield offers SDK support in multiple programming languages, making it straightforward to seamlessly integrate into your application. For further information regarding specific implementations, please visit the following [webpage](/docs/sdks/sdks).

Here are tutorials using the SDKs:

# Implementing One-Click Deployment of BNB Greenfield Website through 4EVERLAND

## Introduction

In the pursuit of rapid and reliable front-end hosting solutions for innovative decentralized applications (dApps), 4EVERLAND has provided BNB Greenfield with an efficient one-click deployment service. This not only simplifies the process of front-end and back-end deployment but also expands the potential for decentralized ownership and economical use of data. 

The following tutorial will meticulously demonstrate the steps and techniques for achieving one-click website deployment on BNB Greenfield through 4EVERLAND.   

## Get Started

### Login 4EVERLAND

In the one-stop service provided by the 4EVERLAND platform, users first need to complete the login process.

As a Web3-oriented solution platform, the website currently supports multiple ways to log in with various wallets. Please select a wallet that suits your usage preferences and sign in.

### The use of the Tril account/upgrade to a standard account

New user logins will automatically create a Tril account and receive free limited-time resources. You will be able to use these resources to build your first decentralized website. Of course, 4EVERLAND provides [flexible solutions](https://docs.4everland.org/get-started/billing-and-pricing/pricing-model) to meet the needs of different users.

On the 4EVERLAND platform, users can choose the services they need from a range of offerings.

### Connect your Github

The next step in the workflow is to link the user's 4EVERLAND account with their Github account, allowing them to pull projects directly from the code repository. Once the link is complete, you will be able to browse your Github code repository in Hosting. 

Additionally, 4EVERLAND's template center provides users with more convenient options, allowing you to start directly with pre-edited templates.

### Select the project and lock in BNB Greenfield

After selecting the project to be deployed, click "Import" and lock the deployment platform as BNB Greenfield. Proceed to edit project names, deployment environments, and other settings.

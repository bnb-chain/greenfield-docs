Greenfield Storage Provider Deployment Guide
============================================

Supported Cloud Providers
-------------------------
We currently support only deployment to AWS (EKS). Other cloud providers (e.g. Alicloud, GCP)
are in our pipeline and will be supported in the future.


Quick Start

For detail about what "storage provider" is on application level, please see

and K8S deployment level.


## Pre-requisites (we assume you already have the following infrastructure):
1. AWS account
2. AWS EKS available
3. K8S kustomize client
4. For monitoring (optional):
     1. Victoria Metrics
     2. Grafana dashboard
     3. Alert channels

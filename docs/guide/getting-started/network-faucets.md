## Testnet Faucet

There are two ways to claim testing tBNB token, please refer to the BSC [faucet doc](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/bsc-faucet) for details. 

## Bridge to Greenfield

Once you claim tBNB, you can transfer tBNB to BNB Greenfield to start testing through [testnet bridge](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/en/bridge).

If not available, you can also use any of the supporting community dApps:

* [DCellar](http://dcellar.io/) builds a bridge for transferring BNB from BSC to Greenfield and vice versa.

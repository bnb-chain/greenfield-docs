# Overview

Greenfield is a decentralized storage infrastructure within the broader BNB chain ecosystem where users and dApps can
create, store, and exchange data with full ownership to form a new data economy. BNB remains the main utility token on
Greenfield, which can be used to pay the gas fee and storage fees.

There is a native cross-chain bridge between Greenfield and BSC (BNB Smart Chain), and BNB can be transferred between BSC
and Greenfield. For more details about the cross-chain, you can refer to [Cross Chain](../greenfield-blockchain/modules/cross-chain.md).

Greenfield defines its account in the same format as BSC and Ethereum, with this compatible address scheme, you can
reuse existing accounts and infrastructure from BSC. For example, you can use TrustWallet, Metamask or other
compatible wallets to deposit your BNB from BSC to Greenfield and interact with dApps on Greenfield. It is also easy
to identify the same owner by referring to the same addresses on both BSC and Greenfield.

:::note
**Greenfield Mainnet has been launched, offering users reliable decentralized storage services. It is important to note
that buckets and objects on Greenfield Testnet will be regularly cleaned. Therefore, please refrain from storing
important data on Greenfield Testnet, considering Greenfield Mainnet instead.**

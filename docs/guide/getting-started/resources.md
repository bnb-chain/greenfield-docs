## Block Explorers

- [GreenfieldScan](https://greenfieldscan.com), developed by TraceReal.
- [BSC Testnet Explorer](hhttps://testnet.bscscan.com/)

## Testnet Faucet

Please use the official BSC testnet faucet and convert it into BNB on Greenfield through Dcellar,
[Check it out →](https://discord.com/invite/bnbchain) and claim in the testnet-faucet channel.

## Bridge

Greenfield Data Network is a separate blockchain system connected to BNB Smart Chain(BSC), Developers usually need to move assets between Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain(BSC). Besides using native bridge SDKs , you can use DCellar as a Bridge WebUI to move your BNB between these two networks.  [Try it out →](https://dcellar.io)

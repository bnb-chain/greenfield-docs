Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you from zero to hero. This doc provides a guide to the following ideas:

* Greenfield & Programmability concepts

* Understand what you need to build your project

* Access resources to get you started

## Greenfield & Programmability Concepts

### Greenfield 101

https://docs.bnbchain.org/greenfield-docs/docs/guide/introduction/overview

### Uniform Address Format

Greenfield defines its account in the same format as BSC and Ethereum. It starts with ECDSA secp256k1 curve for keys and is compliant with [EIP84](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/84) for full [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) paths.

### Account Operation

Create a greenfield account, deposit BNB, and program token transfers.

### Data storage

Create a public bucket to upload and share objects.

### Permission control

Create a private bucket and share it with specific individuals.

### Enhanced permission control

- Create a group, add members, and share the private bucket.

- Resource management with smart contracts: Understand the concepts of resource mirroring https://docs.bnbchain.org/greenfield-docs/docs/guide/core-concept/cross-chain/mirror

### A Quick Start about Data Access Control Through Smart Contract

- Understand the concepts: https://docs.bnbchain.org/greenfield-docs/docs/guide/core-concept/programmability
- Smart Contract SDK: https://docs.bnbchain.org/greenfield-docs/docs/tutorials/access-control/quick-start

### Show Case: Data Marketplace

### How much does it cost to store files in Greenfield?

If you're interested in knowing the real-time pricing for storage and querying on Greenfield, we invite you to the [Price Calculator](https://dcellar.io/pricing-calculator).


### How is my billing calculated?

In Greenfield, bsides transaction fee, users are required to pay two kinds of storage service fees: `storage fee` and `download quota fee`. These storage service fees are charged by Storage Providers (SPs) in a [stream payment](../guide/greenfield-blockchain/modules/billing-and-payment.md). Users need to lock some BNB when they start using the service.

```math
Storage Fee = sum(ChargedSize) * (PrimaryStorePrice + SecondaryStorePrice*SecondarySPNumber) * (1+Validator Tax Rate) * ReserveTime
```

```math
Download Quota Fee = ChargedReadQuota * ReadPrice * (1 + Validator Tax Rate) * ReserveTime
```

Currently,  `ReserveTime` is 180 days and `Validator Tax Rate` is 1%

### What is Charged Size?
The ChargeSize is calculated from the object's payload size, if the payload size is less than 128k then ChargeSize is 128k, otherwise ChargeSize is equal to payload size.

If Data Size < 128K, ChargedSize = 128K; else, ChargedSize = Data Size

If object is an empty folder, ChargedSize = 128K

### What's best practice to store small files in Greenfield?

* The more data bundled, the more $BNB saved

If a single transaction only store a small size file to the Greenfield Network, it is like separate packages being sent through the mail â€“ even though they were all going to the same destination. It's recommended to take all of the files to reach the `Charged Size` and put them together to get sent as one transaction to the network.

* Be Mindful to Delete
Currently, the reserve time to be charged on Greenfield is 6 months. It means a six-month storage fee will charged even for deleted items.

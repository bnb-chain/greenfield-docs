## Data Marketplace
In this part, we are presenting a prototype for a universal data market.
The purpose of this prototype is to offer a simple and straightforward example of how a data market can be built on the BSC network.

We believe that a universal data market can potentially revolutionize the way data is exchanged and utilized. To ensure
that the marketplace is functional, there are several functions that it should provide. These functions include but are not
limited to:

- Data storage and management: The Greenfield can be used to store and manage data to ensure that it is
  easily accessible and organized.
- User authentication and authorization: The Greenfield provides powerful data access control features,
  where user data is often tied to a specific group and only members of that group have permission to access the desired data.
- Listing Data: After users have mirrored their group to BSC, they can set corresponding payment policies through the smart contract of the data marketplace,
  and approve the smart contract to manage the group. Then, users can upload or edit more profiles for this data,
  and these profiles can be stored in the backend of the marketplace.
- Sell Data: After the user pays through the smart contract of the data marketplace, the smart contract will add the user into
  the group as a new member. After the event of adding a new group member occurs,
  it will be reflected on Greenfield within a dozen seconds, and the user will be able to access the purchased data, and also
  get a ERC1155 token as a proof of purchase.
- Payment and billing: Payment and billing is an area where smart contracts excel in handling.
  In the realm of the BSC, there are many valuable digital assets that can be used for payment.
  The payment strategy can be more flexible, allowing users to choose whether to pay a one-time fee or a monthly subscription.
  The platform can receive a portion of the commission, which can incentivize the platform to provide better services.
  Additionally, all payment processes happen on the blockchain, which is transparent and visible to everyone.
- Data preview: Users can either upload public preview data to Greenfield or grant data marketplace for reading
  to automatically generate preview data.
- Search and discovery: The marketplace should have an easy-to-use search and discovery system to help buyers find the data they need,
  which requires a robust indexing backend system.
- Data privacy and security: Greenfield is responsible for data storage and privacy protection, which enables the data
  marketplace to have a very lightweight design in this regard. By not having to worry about these aspects,
  data marketplace can focus on other features and functionalities that will benefit its users.

We hope that this prototype can inspire developers and entrepreneurs to explore the potential of the BSC network for
building innovative and impactful data market solutions.

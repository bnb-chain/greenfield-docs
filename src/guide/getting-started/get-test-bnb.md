# Getting your test BNB

You can claim the test BNB on BSC Testnet by the faucet, and bridge it to Greenfield Testnet.

## Faucet

1. Visit [BNB-Chain discord](https://discord.com/invite/bnbchain) and join the `testnet-faucet` channel.
2. Type `/faucet {your wallet address}` to get test BNB.

## Bridge to Greenfield

[DCellar](http://dcellar.io) builds a bridge for transferring BNB from BSC to Greenfield and vice versa. You can follow
[How to Transfer In](https://docs.nodereal.io/docs/dcellar-get-started#transfer-in) to bridge tBNBs from Greenfield BSC Testnet to
Greenfield Testnet.
